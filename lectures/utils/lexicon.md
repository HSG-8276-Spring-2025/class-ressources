#### JupyterLab
JupyterLab is a newer user interface for Project Jupyter, offering a flexible user interface and more features than the classic notebook UI.

#### Jupyter Notebook
The Jupyter Notebook is an interactive computing environment that enables users to author notebook documents that include: - Live code - Interactive widgets - Plots - Narrative text - Equations - Images - Video. Jupyter Notebooks serve usually as exploratory sandboxes where code can be tested and developed. 
We will mostly use Notebooks in the class for the exercises and case studies. Some slides sets will also have a notebook version. 
To work on a class notebook, you can either run it online using [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)]() , or run locally it from your Anaconda navigator. 

#### Visual Studio Code
Spyder is a free and open source scientific environment for Python, including a code editor, a variable explorer and various other tools. Compared to spyder, VSCode is more complete. Contrary to Spyder, VSCode is not open source as it is developed by Microsoft (it is nonetheless free and cross-platform). 
It also supports jupyter notebook and terminal use.
